# PCB Business Card

## Schematics

## PCB Desgin

## Features:
- NFC functions: Tap your phone on the card to my GitHub.
- GitHub QR Code: Don't want to tap? Scan it! Dive into my GitHub.
- Power Wheel Formula: Quick power calculations. Because who doesn't need a handy formula?
- Ruler: Inches or centimeters, not just a paperweight or a game card. Inspired by Anthony Kouttron’s genius
- Snake Game: Play Snake on LEDs, a nod to Ryan Chen's Tic-Tac-Toe masterpiece. Classic gaming meets the business card – why not?
- Power Source: Powered by a sneaky CR2032 coin battery, borrowed from Brian McEvoy's idea.
